# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Course Project Assignment

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
   each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Solution

Perform the following steps to run this solution.

1. Download ```run_analysis.R``` to your R working directory.
2. Download the data set to your working directory, see CodeBook.md for details.
3. Launch script with ```source("run_analysis.R")```.
4. Script will create ```tiny_data_set.txt``` in your working directory.
